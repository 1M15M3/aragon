# Architecture Guide for the Aragon Client

## Overview

The Aragon client (this repo, `aragon/aragon`) is built as a secure _shell_ that allows a user to create, launch, and manage a decentralized organization. It is meant to be the entry point for users into their decentralized organizations.

Similar to an operating system, users are able to install _applications_ into their organizations, and these _applications_ are securely lauched by the Aragon client in their own sandboxed environments.

In short, some important pieces of the architecture to know about:

- Organizations and their applications are built on top of the [aragonOS smart contract framework](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS)
- Most organizations will be created through an Aragon Template, usually one from [`aragon/dao-kits`](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits)
- Most organizations will have the applications in [`aragon/aragon-apps`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps) installed by default
- Each application is composed of a smart contract and a UI frontend, connected through [aragonAPI](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/tree/master/packages/aragon-api)
- On-chain state from Ethereum is reduced in the Aragon client through [`@aragon/wrapper`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/tree/master/packages/aragon-wrapper), which acts as a Web3 middleware layer
- Application sandboxing is provided through [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) and [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) that are launched by the Aragon client
- Generic UI components are imported from [aragonUI](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-ui) and [Lorikeet](https://github.com/lorikeetui/lorikeet)

Some more documentation about these particular areas are available in the [Developer Portal](https://hack.aragon.org/):

## Finding the right repository to contribute to

If you find an issue, or would like to add a feature, ask yourself these following questions:

- Is it related to the smart contracts?
	- Is it related to the sandboxed applications? **If yes**, make the changes in [`aragon/aragon-apps`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps).
	- Is it related to one of the onboarding templates? **If yes**, you'll want to see if it's a template from [`aragon/dao-kits`](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits).
	- **Else**, [aragonOS](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) is most likely the repo to look at.
- Is it a generic UI component?
	- Would it benefit most frontend developers? **If yes**, [Lorikeet](https://github.com/lorikeetui/lorikeet) is the best place.
	- Would it mostly benefit Aragon-related developers? **If yes**, [aragonUI](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-ui) is the best place.
	- **Else**, add it into `aragon/aragon` üëç.
- Is it in one of the sandboxed applications (e.g. Voting, Token Manager, or Finance from [`aragon/aragon-apps`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps))?
	- Make the changes there!
- Is there something wrong with how the client or one of the apps is talking to Ethereum?
	- [`@aragon/wrapper`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/tree/master/packages/aragon-wrapper) is likely the culprit.
- Is there something you'd like an app to do, but can't?
	- More APIs likely need to be added to [`@aragon/api`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/blob/master/packages/aragon-api) and [`@aragon/wrapper`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/tree/master/packages/aragon-wrapper).
- Is a transaction description no being parsed correctly, or looking weird (e.g. from the Voting app)?
  - It's likely either a problem with the app's radspec strings itself, or the [radspec parser](https://github.com/aragon/radspec).
- **Else**
	- ‚úÖ **This repo is probably the right one to work on!** If you're still not sure, please file an issue and ask us!
